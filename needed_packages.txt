Dear Mohammad,
    You can call on the same number. I will make sure it will be available.
Which image you have ported ? I hope its not angstrom. Still I am sending some code to be runnable in open cv. The corresponding link is below
http://derekmolloy.ie/beaglebone/beaglebone-video-capture-and-image-processing-on-embedded-linux-using-opencv/

You need to have folowing packages installed:

video4linux
ffmpeg
opencv libraries

I suggest you do all above stuff first on your regular PC, then on beagle bone.
Also, the git clone section of the video in link should be skipped as I am directly giving you the code in zip format.

Reply if any further help.
