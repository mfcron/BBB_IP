You need to have a compiler and a make installed.
Run the ``bootstrap`` script you find the in the source directory of CMake.
You can use the ``--help`` option to see the supported options.
You may use the ``--prefix=<install_prefix>`` option to specify a custom
installation directory for CMake. You can run the ``bootstrap`` script from
within the CMake source directory or any other build directory of your
choice. Once this has finished successfully, run ``make`` and
``make install``.  In summary::

 $ ./bootstrap && make && make install
